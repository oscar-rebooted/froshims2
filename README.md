# froshims2
A simple web app based off Harvard's CS50 Flask tutorial that allows you to register for sports

If I had more time I would work on the following 
- admin accounts, where only admins can see the admin_dashboard and create other admins
- better session management than just session dictionary. Use Flask-Login rather than session module
- create an API endpoint where you can access the list of registrations in JSON
- CSRF Tokens using Flask-WTF for enhanced security
- implementing 0auth to learn about best practices
